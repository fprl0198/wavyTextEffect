Wave effect for text with SASS

The SASS / main.scss file is not really necessary. Browsers only read CSS. 

If you want to continue using SASS to practice, you will need to download the dependencies and run the SASS precompiler (you must have nodejs installed).

Locate yourself in the project folder, then run the following commands.

1. Install dependencies
   npm install package.json

2. Run SASS
   npn run compile:sass
